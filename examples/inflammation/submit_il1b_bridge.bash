# Note 1: This will start ($nodes * $cores) total MPI processes using $cores per node.  
#           If you want some other number of processes, add "-np N" after the mpiexec, where N is the total you want.
#           Example:  mpiexec -np 44  ......(for a 2 node job, this will load 36 processes on the first node and 8 processes on the second node)
#           If you want a specific number of process to run on each node, (thus increasing the effective memory per core), use the --npernode option.
#           Example: mpiexec -np 24 --npernode 12  ......(for a 2 node job, this will load 12 processes on each node)

# The default version of Open MPI is version 1.10.

# For openmpi 1.10: mpiexec --bind-to core --npernode 8 --n PUT_THE_TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_MPI_PROCESSES_HERE /path/to/executable [--args...]

# To submit your job, do:
# sbatch <script_name>

#The slurm output file will by default, be written into the directory you submitted your job from  (slurm-JOBID.out)
